            Perhaps the easiest to digest and most visibly apparent differentiating factor among keyboards is their form factor, or which keys they include and exclude. Colloquially referred to as the keyboard's size, though this is not to be confused with the physical dimensions of any particular keyboard. While there are many sizes available on the market, we will focus on the three most common sizes:
            <ul>
              <li>full-size</li>
              <li>TKL</li>
              <li>60%</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Keycaps</h2>
          <p>
            Keycaps are defined by two primary characteristics: their height and the material they are constructed with. Height can be anything from thin, low-profile keycaps, to extra tall "SA" profile keycaps. Materials can include all sorts of exotic, even hand crafted stuff, but the most common are ABS and PBT plastics.
